#### About

Student hours is a nicer way of saying office hours. During the period listed below I am available for anything you may want to discuss related to the course. Or even things not related to the course. During my scheduled availability I am around to provide as much help as you feel you need related to the course, whether that's a quick question or a more detailed discussion.

#### Schedule

Student hours for the Spring 2025 semester are from 1PM-2PM Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. If you are unable to attend student hours due to schedule conflicts, please email me, I am happy to schedule an alternative time to meet with you.

#### Location

By default meetings are in my office. I am also available for virtual meetings on Zoom, email me to schedule a time and get the Zoom meeting information.

#### Meeting material

+ If we are meeting to discuss an assignment draft, please try to send the material ahead of time. Submitting your work ahead of time is not required, but it will enable more discussion of your work when you attend
+ You do not need a complete draft to attend office hours. The more you have, however, the more feedback I can provide in our meeting.
